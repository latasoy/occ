  <p>
    If you think you already have an OATS account, and you were just trying to associate a new
    authentication with your existing account, then you’re in the wrong place.
    You’re not logged into OATS right now.
  </p>

  <p class="small nomargin">
    If you have a OATS account, and you’d like to associate another authentication with it, here’s what to do:
  </p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Log in in to OATS with your existing authentication service</li>
    <li>Go to your settings page (located at the top/right corner of the page)
    <li>Add one or more accounts to be used to sign-in</li>
  </ul>
